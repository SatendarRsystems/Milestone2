The following points need to understand: 
1)	Application will run on Firefox/Chrome. There are some problem at latest SDK so we need to add some extra code for Chrome Browser. 
2)  	Application will run on localhost or https only.
3)  	For dynamic rendering, we are using third party code from https://stackblitz.com.
4)  	Download the code and run index.html file for setup video. 
5)	Need to generate token from vidyo website after login. i.e. https://developer.vidyo.io/#/generate-token
	So we need to use username, application id and token from vidyo page to demo html.
6)	We do not have any permanent token, so sometime token expires. So we need to regenerate token from vidyo website. Please make your own login at vidyo , generate token and then use at demo html page. We need to update three value i.e. username, application id and token at index.html page.
